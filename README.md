# Station2vec: Regional function discovery based on metro passenger flow data embedding
###The application of neural language models (word2vec) in stations sequences.
We discover that passenger flow of stations indeed implies regional functions and there is a certain correlation between a sequence of stations the passenger passing through, so we consider the sequence as a sentence and propose Station2vec to capture the contextual relationships in each sequence.<br>
The Station2vec framework consists of two components: (1) station corpus extraction, (2) station embedding.<br>
